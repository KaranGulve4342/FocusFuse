![What exactly are quantum computers?](/static/images/episodes/quantum.jpg)

Quantum computers are machines that compute numbers using quantum mechanics to calculate numbers. But what makes quantum computers different from the classical ones and why the buzz? The answer to this lies in the time they take for calculations. Quantum Computers are no different than classical computers and all the classical computers can do is anything that quantum computers can't do; they just require more memory and time. So, Quantum computers are just super efficient computers and what gives them this edge lies in quantum physics. The classical computers use bits(0s and 1s) to calculate stuff. But the quantum ones use quantum bits or qubits, which help them perform calculations at light speed.

# What are qubits?

Qubits are the basic units of information in quantum computers analogous to classical bits in classical computing. Unlike classical bits a qubit can exist in superposition of its two “basis” states. According to the principle of quantum superposition the bit can exist as both 1 and 0 at the same time. 

The superposition property allows qubits to represent and process multiple states simultaneously, enabling quantum computers to perform certain calculations much more efficiently. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow the quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly. But maintaining coherence and minimizing errors in qubit operations are significant challenges in the development of practical quantum computing hardware.

Furthermore, qubits can be implemented using various physical systems, such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and photons. Each qubit implementation has its own advantages and challenges, and researchers are actively exploring different approaches to build scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computers.

# Use of quantum computing to simulate Human Body and chronic diseases.

The human body is a marvel of intricacy, with countless molecular interactions governing its function and health. Traditional computational methods often struggle to accurately model these complex biological systems due to their sheer scale and intricacy. Enter quantum computing – with its ability to simulate quantum mechanical phenomena and model molecular interactions at an unprecedented level of detail. Quantum simulations offer a window into the inner workings of biological processes, shedding light on disease mechanisms and potential treatment avenues.

Chronic diseases, from cancer to Alzheimer's, pose formidable challenges to modern medicine, with their multifaceted etiology and elusive treatment options. Quantum computing provides a powerful tool for unraveling the complexities of chronic diseases, from understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms to identifying novel therapeutic targets. By simulating disease pathways and predicting patient outcomes, quantum-assisted disease modeling holds the key to unlocking new treatment modalities and improving patient care.

# Quantum computing and Cybersecurity

At the heart of quantum computing's impact on cybersecurity lies its ability to break traditional encryption schemes. With algorithms like Shor's poised to efficiently factor large numbers, stalwart cryptographic protocols such as RSA face unprecedented vulnerability. This prospect raises critical concerns about the security of sensitive data encrypted using these protocols, urging a proactive response from the cybersecurity community.

Amidst the looming threat of encryption breaches, researchers are forging ahead to develop quantum-resistant or post-quantum cryptographic protocols. These next-generation algorithms, built upon mathematical problems deemed formidable even for quantum computers, hold the promise of safeguarding our digital assets in the quantum computing era. The quest for quantum-safe cryptography represents a beacon of hope in the quest for resilient cybersecurity solutions.
